                <p class="text-body">Hi there! I'm Bala, 24, junior developer, living in Los Angeles. I moved to America almost 16 years ago with my family from South Africa.
                    We came for the same reason everyone does: A chance at the American dream. I started working when I was 10 years old helping my dad run his small bussiness
                    selling oil paintings at malls thorughout Southern California.<br><br>On my 20th birthday I moved out with my then girlfriend to Los Angeles where she had gotten 
                    accepted to UCLA and I started at Pasadena City College. We both took full time jobs and worked to support ourselves while going to school. 
                    I lived and worked for 3 years under the table without papers before marrying my girlfriend and getting my green card. 
                    I am now at University doing my senior year of computer science, and in pursuit of my first job in the industry.
